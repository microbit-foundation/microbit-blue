<h1>Demo List</h1>
<p>For hex files to load onto your micro:bit and further information go to http://bluetooth-mdw.blogspot.co.uk/p/bbc-microbit.html</p>
<p>The demo list screen lists each available demo. There are probably more than your phone can display on one screen so remember to scroll down to see the full list. You can find more information on each demo in its own Help page.</p>
<p>Note that if your micro:bit disconnects for some reason, you should go back to the Device List and select it again. This will reconnect you provided your micro:bit is in the right state.</p>
<p>
    All the code for this demo can be found in ui.MenuActivity.java except for the Bluetooth operations which are in bluetooth.BleAdapterService.
